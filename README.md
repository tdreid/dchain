**dchain** is a [blockchain][1] implementation for demonstration only. It is 
not suitable for [cryptocurrency][2] or any other production application. It 
illustrates basic concepts in creating a tamper resistant online ledger 
including: cryptographically signing transactions, using hashes to check 
for tampering and proof-of-work.
